    ```

- Learned how to add images: 

    ```markdown
    ![Image](src)
    ```
    ![Image](Images/Dorel.png)
    
    ***DO NOT EXPECT ME TO PUT SERIOUS IMAGES***

- I learned to use codeblocks: 
    ````
    ```language

    console.log('This is some code');
    
    ```
    ````

- Also learned about quotes: 
    ```markdown
    > This is a quote
    ```
> This is also a quote



- I learned how to add JavaScript scripts:

    ```html
    <!--It uses raw HTML `<script>` tag-->
    <script src="index.js"></script>
    ``` 

<style>
.finger-pointer {
    cursor: pointer;
}
</style>

<p onclick="changeColor()" id="demo" class="finger-pointer">This text changes color on click</p>
